These are instructions how to build the Coda file system.


1. Subsystems
2. Build procedure



1.  There are 5 subsystems that need to be build

	a) kernel-src kernel code for coda filesystem calls and 
	   inode manipulation kernel code.
	b) lib-src contains libraries needed by other components,
	   including a threads package used by many other user
	   level components
	c) rvm-src contains the rvm transaction package, depends 
           on threads
        d) coda-src contains source for coda, depends on a, b, c
        e) util-src contains a variety of tools, for testing, kernel
           hacking helps. Dependency varies.


2.  Building coda. 
	a) at the top level type make config, answer the questions
	b) at the top level type make coda
	c) at the top level type make install-client, or make install-server
	d) rebuild kernels if needed
	e) configure clients/servers and you should be up.
