Basic Installation
==================

Obtaining the sources
---------------------

The sources can be downloaded from:
    ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/coda/src/rpc2-6.x.y.tar.gz

Or obtained from the anonymous CVS repository:

Autoconf must be installed on your system in order to set up the build
environment.  Autoconf 2.59 is known to work.  (The coda sources,
unlike lwp, rpc2 and rvm, do not yet use automake and libtool.)

    $ cvs -d':pserver:anonymous@coda.cs.cmu.edu:/coda-src' login
    Password: <return>
    $ cvs -d':pserver:anonymous@coda.cs.cmu.edu:/coda-src' co coda
    $ cd coda
    $ ./bootstrap.sh

From here the everything is identical to (but possibly more up-to-date
than) using the tarball from the Coda ftp site.

Prerequisites
-------------

GNU Make is required to build coda; 3.80 is known to work.

Perl is required; 5.6.1 is known to work.

GNU readline is used by a large number of programs.  [FIXME: describe what you
lose without readline, and how much it matters.]

Configuring
-----------

Run the ./configure script. The default installation path is /usr/local, but
this can be modified by using the --prefix option.

Building and installing
-----------------------

# The following assumes that GNU make is gmake.

# Build the entire tree (libraries, client (venus), server (codasrv)
$ gmake

# Install the libraries and programs
$ gmake install

# Note that one may do both installs with no ill effects, e.g. on a
# server that is also a client.
