Adding a new data collection call to mond.

(1) add the call spec and associated data types to mond.rpc2

(2) add a type name to the enum dataClass in mondgen.h for each new type.

(3) add a subclass of vmon_data in data.h for each new type, defining
Type and Report as inline methods.  Add any methods you may need for
constructors, destructors, or support methods.

(4) add the method <class>::init() and <class>::Release() in data.c
for each new type.  This is also a good time to write any class
constructors (e.g. to allocate space for strings, etc.)

(5) add the case for this type in bufpool::getSlot in data.c

(6) add a buffer pool for each new type in data.c.  Add the extern
declaration for the pool in data.h.  Add the prefetch for the buffers
in mondutil.c (Buff_Init).

(7) add the headers for Report* in report.h; add the
definitions for Report* and MondReport* (or VmonReport*/SmonReport*).

(8) in the talker thread, add the cases for freeing the buffer entry
