# Script to install modified sources into RCS and in alpha source directory #
############################################################################# 


# No arguments; typically invoked via make in a directory whose name is <module>
#	E.g. (cd /coda/usr/satya/venus; make install)
#
# Expects
#	-  symlink named RCS in the current directory.
#	-  a file named RCSMSG in the current directory.
#	-  the environment variables SRCDIR and MAKEPSD
#	   (these are defined by Coda Makeconf and CMU-CS make respectively)
#
# Checks for $FREEZE_FILE (defined below) and will not check in changes if this
# file exists.
#
# cd's into MAKEPSD and obtains names of all files in it.
#
# Excludes those files with explicitly IGNORE-able extensions (specified below).
#
# Prompts the user about any other files not already in RCS.
#
# Checks in the appropriate files (from above) with the checkin message in RCSMSG.
#
# Checks out the newly-checked-in files (unlocked) in the current dir & SRCDIR/<module>
#
# Can be suppressed by setting environment variable SUPPRESS_ALPHACI
