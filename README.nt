Coda Servers for Windows NT
---------------------------

This release of Coda has alpha support for Coda servers running on NT
and Windows 95.  The Win32 binaries are constructed using the Cygnus
Win32 kit, which effectively translates Unix system calls to Win32
calls.

We build the Win32 binaries on Linux workstations using a cross
compiler, just for our convenience.

NOTE: there is no client support for NT yet.

Building
--------

1. Get the cross compiling kit:
ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/tools/win32/cygwin-b19_glibc-2.i386.rpm

You also need:
ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/tools/win32/libgdbm-nt-1.7.3-2.i386.rpm

(These are rpms for RedHat 5.0. Sources are available of course.)

2. Get a tar ball of release 4.6.0 or higher:

ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/coda/src

3. Unpack & build

./configure --host=nt
make coda

Installing
----------
