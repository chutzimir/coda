Lastly, we need a file of conventions in C files.

	The first C convention is that we are using the conditionals:

	#ifdef	__linux__		for linux
	#ifdef	__MACH__		for Mach
	#ifdef	__NetBSD__		for NetBSD

	#if defined(__linux__) || defined(__NetBSD)
					as a more complex example for
					code that runs on linux & NetBSD

	#endif /* XXX */		to end a conditional iff it is
					several lines.  XXX would be 
					__linux__, __MACH__, etc
