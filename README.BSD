This file is README.BSD, rewritten by Greg Troxel and current as of
2004-02-24.

* INTRODUCTION

Most BSDs have support for coda in the kernel already.  There is a
minor complication of version 2 versus version 3 of the venus/kernel
interface.  This file is in Coda 6, which uses version 3 in order to
support multiple realms.

This file contains BSD-specific notes.  Also see INSTALL.

* KERNEL SUPPORT

To use Coda 6, you must have version 3 'pseudo-device vcoda' (only one
needed, but people typically put in 4), and 'file-system CODA' in your
kernel config.  Some systems have version 3, and some require patches.

You must ensure that /dev/cfs0 exists.

** NetBSD

If /dev/cfs0 does not exist (it is not created by default on 1.6.2 or
-current), run ./MAKEDEV cfs0.

NetBSD-current (as of 2004-01) has up-to-date version 3 support.
Ensure that the two lines above are in the kernel config and simply
compile coda.

NetBSD 1.6.2 (the entire netbsd-1-6 branch) has version 2 support.
Apply Phil Nelson's patch at:
  ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/coda/netbsd/netbsd-1.6-realms.patch
and build a new kernel

Some bugs were fixed in 2003 in vnode handling in the kernel code.  It
is recommnded to be running either recent -current or netbsd-1-6.
Aside from having to apply the patch, -current and netbsd-1-6 are
equally good from the coda viewpoint.

** FreeBSD

Check /dev/cfs0 and create it if it is missing.
[XXX Does MAKEDEV support this?  If not, what numbers to use?]

[XXX Explain whether 4.9, 5.2, and -current have realms support.]

Obtain the realms patch for 4.8 or -current from
  ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/coda/freebsd/
and build a new kernel.

** OpenBSD

[unknown.  check /dev/cfs0, and see if the kernel support in sys/coda
is version 2.  If so, apply the netbsd-1-6 patch, which might or might
not be hard.]

** Darwin

As of this writing, there is not known to be kernel support.  Study
the vnode interface in Darwin, and adapt either FreeBSD or NetBSD's
sys/coda to Darwin.  Put the resulting patch on your web site, and
send email announcing it to codalist@coda.cs.cmu.edu

** BSDI

[unknown]

* PREREQUISITES

** ALL SYSTEMS

Ensure that GNU make, autoconf, perl, and GNU readline are installed.
Use pkgsrc (NetBSD) or ports (FreeBSD/OpenBSD), and refer to your OS's
documentation for help - there is nothing coda-specific about
installing these packages.

** PKGSRC (NetBSD and others):

When configuring, pass LDFLAGS and CFLAGS so that programs in /usr/pkg
(namely readline) will be found.  The following may be helpful:

#!/bin/sh
for i in lwp rpc2 rvm coda; do
  echo "BUILDING $i" && \
  (cd $i && \
  ./bootstrap.sh && \
  rm -f config.cache && \
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib" CFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include" CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/coda && \
  gmake -k clean && 
  gmake -k &&
  gmake install)
done
(cd coda && gmake -k client-install server-install)
