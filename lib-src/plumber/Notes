andrewos.h is in /afs/andrew/itc/src/base/itc-config/config/andrewos.h
	includes system.h (that's about it), which contains machine
	specific stuff, like in 
        /afs/andrew/itc/src/base/itc-config/config/sun4_40/system.h

The Imakefile is junk.  Makefile is a link to Makefile.coda, which
	has the advantage that /usr/cs/bin/make doesn't spit at it.

Added an #ifndef __STDC__ to the defintions of {m,re,c}alloc in 
        malloc.h; ANSI code that includes <stdlib.h> are distinctly
        upset by seeing them defined to return both char * and void *
