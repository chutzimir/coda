.CM 1
.SH "NAME"
chrarg \- parse character argument or ask user
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B
int chrarg (ptr,brk,prompt,legals,defalt);
.br
.B
char **ptr,*brk,*prompt,*legals,defalt;
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I
Chrarg
attemps to parse an argument from a string, passing
the string pointer
.I
ptr
and the break character set
.I
brk
to the
.IR nxtarg (3)
routine.
If there is an argument parsed, and
it begins with a character which is present in the
string
.I
legals
of legal character responses, then the index of that
character within
.I
legals
is returned.
If there is no argument, or if it does
not begin with a legal character, then the parameters
.I
prompt, legals,
and
.I
defalt
are passed to the
.IR getchr (3)
routine, whose value is then returned by
.I
chrarg.
.sp
.I
Chrarg
is especially useful for parsing character values
from argument lists in programs using the command interpreter,
.IR ci (3).
.SH "LIBRARY NOTES"
You must link against /usr/local/lib/libcs.a to define this routine.
