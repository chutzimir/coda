/*  getstab  --  ask user for string in table
 *
 *  Usage:  i = getstab (prompt,table,defalt)
 *	int i;
 *	char *prompt, **table, *defalt;
 *
 *  Getstab prints the messge:	prompt  [defalt]
 *  and asks the user to type in a line.  This input text
 *  is compared to all the strings in the table to see which
 *  (if any) it matches; the stablk() routine is used
 *  for the matching.  If the string is ambiguous or invalid
 *  (i.e. matches zero strings, or more than one), the cycle
 *  is repeated.  When a valid string is typed, the index
 *  of the string it matches is returned.  If the user just
 *  types carriage return, the default string is used for matching.
 *  The default is also used on error or EOF in standard input.
 *  The string table may be declared in this way:
 * 	char *table[] = {"string1","string2",...,0};
