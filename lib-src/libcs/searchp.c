/*  searchp  --  search through pathlist for file
 *
 *  Usage:  p = searchp (path,file,fullname,func);
 *	char *p, *path, *file, *fullname;
 *	int (*func)();
 *
 *  Searchp will parse "path", a list of pathnames separated
 *  by colons, prepending each pathname to "file".  The resulting
 *  filename will be passed to "func", a function provided by the
 *  user.  This function must return zero if the search is
 *  successful (i.e. ended), and non-zero if the search must
 *  continue.  If the function returns zero (success), then
 *  searching stops, the full filename is placed into "fullname",
 *  and searchp returns 0.  If the pathnames are all unsuccessfully
 *  examined, then searchp returns -1.
 *  If "file" begins with a slash, it is assumed to be an
 *  absolute pathname and the "path" list is not used.  Note
 *  that this rule is used by Bell's cc also; whereas Bell's
 *  sh uses the rule that any filename which CONTAINS a slash
 *  is assumed to be absolute.  The execlp and execvp procedures
 *  also use this latter rule.  In my opinion, this is bogosity.
