.SH "NAME"
foldup, folddown \- perform case-folding on strings
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B
char *foldup (out,in);
.br
.B
char *folddown (out,in);
.br
.B
char *out,*in;
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I
Foldup
and
.I
folddown
perform case-folding (to upper or lower case, respectively)
on strings.
The string at
.I
in
is copied to the buffer at
.I
out,
changing letters as appropriate.
Only letters are affected.
.sp
It is
.I
specifically allowed
for
.I
out
and
.I
in
to specify the same string; in this manner, in-place case folding
is possible.
Both folding routines return
.I
out
as their value, for convenience.
.SH "LIBRARY NOTES"
You must link against /usr/local/lib/libcs.a to define these routines.
.SH "BUGS"
No "inversion" mode is provided.
In-place case folding is accomplished
by specifying
.I
out
and
.I
in
as the same string; this is a rather cumbersome way to specify the most
common manner of case-folding.
