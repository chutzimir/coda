 *  nxtarg -- strip off arguments from a string
 *
 *  Usage:  p = nxtarg (&q,brk);
 *	char *p,*q,*brk;
 *	extern char _argbreak;
 *
 *	q is pointer to next argument in string
 *	after call, p points to string containing argument,
 *	q points to remainder of string
 *
 *  Leading blanks and tabs are skipped; the argument ends at the
 *  first occurence of one of the characters in the string "brk".
 *  When such a character is found, it is put into the external
 *  variable "_argbreak", and replaced by a null character; if the
 *  arg string ends before that, then the null character is
 *  placed into _argbreak;
 *  If "brk" is 0, then " " is substituted.
