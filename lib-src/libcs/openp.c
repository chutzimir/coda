/*  openp, fopenp  --  search pathlist and open file
 *
 *  Usage:
 *	i = openp (path,file,complete,flags,mode)
 *	f = fopenp (path,file,complete,type)
 *	int i,flags,mode;
 *	FILE *f;
 *	char *path,*file,*complete,*type;
 *
 *  Openp searches for "file" in the pathlist "path";
 *  when the file is found and can be opened by open()
 *  with the specified "flags" and "mode", then the full filename
 *  is copied into "complete" and openp returns the file
 *  descriptor.  If no such file is found, openp returns -1.
 *  Fopenp performs the same function, using fopen() instead
 *  of open() and type instead of flags/mode; it returns 0 if no
 *  file is found.
