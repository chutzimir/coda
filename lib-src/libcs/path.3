.SH "NAME"
path \- split pathname into directory and file parts
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B
path (pathname,direc,file);
.br
.B
char *pathname,*direc,*file;
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I
Path
breaks a complete pathname into a filename part and a directory part.
It handles all pathnames allowed in UNIX.
The resulting filename will
not have trailing slashes, and will not be null.
The resulting
directory name will not be null.
.sp
You provide three strings:
.I
pathname,
the complete name to be split,
.I
direc,
a buffer into which the directory part will be copied, and
.I
file,
a buffer to hold the filename part.
You must ensure that the
buffers are big enough.
.sp
The handling of most names is obvious, but several special cases
exist.
The name "f", containing no slashes, is split into
directory "." and filename "f".
The name "/" is directory "/" and
filename ".".
The path "" is directory "." and filename ".".
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IR getwd (3),
.IR expand (3)
.SH "BUGS"
The string
.I
direc
must be big enough to hold the entire pathname, since it is used
as working storage by
.I
path.
.sp
A possible future modification to
.I
path
would add the additional proviso that the directory part
will be an absolute pathname.
The implementation of this
is simple -- you perform
.I
getwd,
and prepend the value (with a separating "/"), but only
if the original
.I
pathname
is not absolute (i.e.
does not begin with "/").
It is also
possible (but not necessary) to resolve initial "../"
substrings in
.I
pathname
at that time.
.SH "LIBRARY NOTES"
You must link against /usr/local/lib/libcs.a to define this routine.
