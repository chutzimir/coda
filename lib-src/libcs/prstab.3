.SH "NAME"
prstab, fprstab \- print string table using multiple columns
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B
prstab(table);
.br
.B
char **table;
.sp
.B
fprstab(file, list)
.br
.B
FILE *file;
.br
.B
char **list;
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I
Prstab
prints all the strings in the string table
.I
table.
It uses some heuristics to decide how many columns should be printed,
and prints the names in order reading down the columns (i.e.
column-major
order).
It's usually superior to just listing all the names in one long
column, and it's smart enough to use a single column if there are just
a few names.
.sp
The string table for
.I
prstab
can be declared just like a table for
.IR stablk (3),
i.e.:
.nf
.sp
	char *table[] = { "first", "second", ..., "last", 0};
.fi
.SH "LIBRARY NOTES"
You must link against /usr/local/lib/libcs.a to define this routine.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IR stablk (3)
.SH "BUGS"
Several constants are wired-in.
.I
Prstab
assumes that there are 80 columns on the page, and that a leading
tab is like 7 or 8 spaces.
It leaves 5 spaces more than the longest
of all strings between columns, and likes to print at least 8 rows
if there are just a few strings.
