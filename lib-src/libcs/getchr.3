.TH GETCHR 3 10/23/82
.CM 3
.SH "NAME"
getchr \- ask user to type a character
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B
#include <stdio.h>
.sp
.B
int getchr (prompt,legals,defalt);
.br
.B
char *prompt,*legals,defalt;
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I
Getchr
will print its prompt and ask the user for a single character.
If that
charactter is in the string of legal response characters
.RI ( legals ),
then its index is returned.
If a null string is typed (just a
carriage return), then the default character
.RI ( defalt )
will be assumed and its index returned.
If a character is typed
which is not in the string of legal responses, then an error message
is printed and the prompt-and-response cycle is repeated.
.SH "LIBRARY NOTES"
You must link against /usr/local/lib/libcs.a to define this routine.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IR getbool (3), 
.IR getstr (3), 
.IR getstab (3), 
etc.
.br
.IR chrarg (3)
.SH "BUGS"
There is no provision for an escape response (e.g.
"I don't like any
of these choices").
