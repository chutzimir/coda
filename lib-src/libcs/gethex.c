/*  gethex --  prompt user for hexadecimal integer
 *
 *  Usage:  i = gethex (prompt,min,max,defalt)
 *	unsigned int i,min,max,defalt;
 *	char *prompt;
 *
 *  Gethex prints the message:  prompt  (min to max, hexadecimal)  [defalt]
 *  and accepts a line of input from the user.  If the input
 *  is not null or numeric, an error message is printed; otherwise,
 *  the value is converted to an hexadecimal integer (or the value "defalt" is
 *  substituted if the input is null).  Then, the value is
 *  checked to ensure that is lies within the range "min" to "max".
 *  If it does not, an error message is printed.  As long as
 *  errors occur, the cycle is repeated; when a legal value is
 *  entered, this value is returned by gethex.
 *  On error or EOF in the standard input, the default is returned.
