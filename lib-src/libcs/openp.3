.SH "NAME"
openp, fopenp \- search for file and open it
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B 
#include <sys/file.h>
.br
.B 
int openp (searchlist, path, buffer, flags, mode);
.br
.B 
char *searchlist, *path, *buffer;
.br
.B 
int flags, mode;

.B 
#include <sys/file.h>
.br
.B 
#include <stdio.h>
.br
.B 
FILE *fopenp (searchlist,path,buffer,type);
.br
.B 
char *searchlist, *path, *buffer ,*type;
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I 
Openp
and
.I 
fopenp
use
.IR searchp (3)
to search for a file, and open the file when and if it is
found.
The value returned will be the normal value of
.IR open (2)
or
.IR fopen (3s)
-- a file descriptor or FILE pointer on success, and a
\-1 or a 0 on failure.

.I 
Searchlist
is assumed to be a list of directory path names separated by colons;
one by one, these names are parsed and concatenated (with a
separating slash) onto
.I 
path
to form a complete file path name.
An attempt is then made to
open the file with this name; if successful,
.I 
openp
and
.I 
fopenp
return with a success indication; otherwise, searching
continues.
If success is achieved, then the resulting
pathname is copied into the string
.I 
buffer,
provided by the user.
The
.I 
open
and
.I 
fopen
calls are made with the appropriate
.I 
mode, flags
and
.I 
type
as specified by the parameter. The 
.IR open(2)
and
.IR fopen(3S)
define what
.I 
mode, flags
and
.I 
type
should be respectively.
.SH "LIBRARY NOTES"
You must link against /usr/local/lib/libcs.a to define this routine.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.IR open (2), 
.IR fopen (3s), 
.IR wantread (3), 
.IR wantwrite (3),
.IR fwantread (3),

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.I 
Openp
returns \-1 on error (no openable file found);
.I 
fopenp
returns 0.
