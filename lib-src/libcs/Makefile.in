#	(b) installation into /coda/project/coda/{lib,include}-special
#	(c) installation with standalone distributions of RPC2 and friends.
#
# In case (c), the Makeconf file needs to be renamed
# so that variables like CFLAGS, LIBDIR and INCLDIR are inherited
# from the Makeconf in the parent directory.  The MAKEDIST script included
# with the distribution does this.
