.SH "NAME"
stabsearch \- best-match string table lookup
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B
int stabsearch (string,table,quiet);
.br
.B
char *string,**table;
.br
.B
int quiet;
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I
Stabsearch
searches in the string table
.IR table ,
looking for a string which best matches
.IR string .
If exactly one such string is found, then the index
of that string is returned.
If no such strings are found,
then \-1 is returned.
.sp
If
.I
quiet
is false and several strings match reasonably, the user is given
the option to approve or disapprove of the choice of matching
strings.  If he disapproves, then the few best matches are listed
and \-1 is returned.
.sp
If several strings match, then \-2 will be returned.
Before
returning, if
.I
quiet
is 0, then the user will be asked if he wants a list
of matching strings; if he says "yes", then a list is printed.
.sp
The string table may be declared like this:
.sp
.nf
.RS
char *stable[] = {
	"first string",
	"second string",
	...
	"n-th string",
	0};
.RE
.fi
.sp
Note that the last entry of the table must be a zero.
.SH "LIBRARY NOTES"
You must link against /usr/local/lib/libcs.a to define this routine.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IR stablk (3), 
.IR srchscore (3)
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
If nothing matches at all, or if the user does not approve
the choice of the best matching string, \-1 is returned.
