.SH NAME
nxtarg \- parse arguments from a string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 
extern char _argbreak;
.sp
.B 
char *nxtarg (p,brk);
.br
.B
char **p,*brk;
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I 
Nxtarg
is used to parse a string, picking off one argument
with each call of
.I 
nxtarg.
The arguments are separated by some special "break"
characters, and may additionally be surrounded by
leading and trailing blanks and tabs.

When you have a string which you wish to parse, you should
declare a pointer and point to the start of the string:
.nf

.RS
.ta \w'char string[100];        'u
char string[100];	/* the arg list */
char *pointer;	/* a pointer */
char *argument;	/* one argument */
.li
...
pointer = string;	/* start of arg list */
.DT
.RE
.fi

Then, each call to
.I 
nxtarg
will fetch the next argument:

.RS
argument = nxtarg (&pointer,"delimiters");
.RE

Each call to 
.I nxtarg 
will space the pointer up to one of the
delimiters or the end of the string, whichever comes first.
Then, the string will be chopped into two pieces: the part
containing the argument just parsed, and the rest of the string.
The address of the first part will be returned; the pointer
will be left pointing to the second part, all ready for the
next call to 
.IR nxtarg .
Note that the pointer must not be in a register, since it
is passed by address.

The delimiter character (or null character at the end of the string)
encountered is placed into the external variable called,
.I 
_argbreak.
You may look at this value to see what delimiter was encountered.
If no delimiters were encountered before the end of the string,
then the null character will be placed into
.I 
_argbreak.

If
.I 
brk,
the list of break characters, is 0, then the space character will
be used as the only delimiter.
.SH "LIBRARY NOTES"
You must link against /usr/local/lib/libcs.a to define this routine.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.IR scanf (3), 
.IR boolarg (3), 
.IR intarg (3), 
.IR stabarg (3), 
.IR strarg (3), 
etc.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If the argument points to the null string,
or the end of the string is reached,
then a pointer to the null string will be returned.
At the
end of the string, 
.IR nxtarg () 
may be repeated any number of
times -- it will continue to leave the pointer unchanged,
and return a pointer to the null string.
