/*  path  --  break filename into directory and file
 *
 *  path (filename,direc,file);
 *  char *filename,*direc,*file;
 *  filename is input; direc and file are output (user-supplied).
 *  file will not have any trailing /; direc might.
 *
 *  Note these rules:
 *  1.  trailing / are ignored (except as first character)
 *  2.  x/y is x;y where y contains no / (x may contain /)
 *  3.  /y  is /;y where y contains no /
 *  4.  y   is .;y where y contains no /
 *  5.      is .;. (null filename)
 *  6.  /   is /;. (the root directory)
 *
 * Algorithm is this:
 *  1.  delete trailing / except in first position
 *  2.  if any /, find last one; change to null; y++
 *      else y = x;		(x is direc; y is file)
 *  3.  if y is null, y = .
 *  4.  if x equals y, x = .
 *      else if x is null, x = /
