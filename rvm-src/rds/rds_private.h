 *Type definitions
 */

/*
 * Rather than wasting cycles to manage locks which will only produce a
 * small amount of concurrency, We decided to have one mutex on the entire
 * heap. With the exception of coalescing, none of the routines should take
 * substantial time since most are memory changes and simple computations.
 */

/* Synchronization and Threads support */

/* 
 * We can have one of three thread models: 
 *          cthreads:         Mach threads (kernel or coroutine)
 *          lwp:              Coda's lightweight process package
 *          pthreads:         POSIX threads
 *
 * If RVM_USELWP is defined, then lwp support is compiled in.
 * If RVM_USEPT  is defined, then pthreads support is compiled in.
 * If niether of these is defined, then cthreads support is compiled in.
 *
 * It is assumed in the rds package that cthreads and pthreads use
 * preemptive scheduling, and they are synchronized appropriately.
 * 
 * You must define only one of the above targets, and it must be defined
 * consistently across the following packages: RVM, RDS, and URT
