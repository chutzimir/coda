/* we create our own transactions in the following routines, even
 * though there is a tid in the interface. This might result in unreferenced
 * objects if the thread which malloc'ed the object decides to abort. These
 * routines have no way of knowing if such an event happens. Also, if the user
 * free's then aborts, could have pointers into the free list objects.
 *
 * Interface has been changed so that if a user feels confident that his
 * transactions are serialized, (the above problem won't arise), he can pass
 * in a non-null tid ptr and it will be used. So if you aren't sure, make the
 * tidptr is zero!
