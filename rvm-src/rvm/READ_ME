    	    	    	    RVM Release 1.2 3 Mar 1993

This version replaces the previous alpha version and contains only a bug fix
that was causing misreds on mapping raw partitions.

The log format is the same as the previous alpha version (21 Dec., 1992), so 
no re-init needs to be done.

The header file rvm.h has a fix to the definition of the symbol MAX_READ_LEN.
If you don't use that symbol, make -t will be sufficient to synchronize
comnpilations.
