The new handy dandy partition and inode interface are here!

Partition have methods, but for backward compatibility a call to
icreate(dev, .....)  will find the partition belonging to the device
and invoke the right method.

Vicetab file
============

To be placed in /vice/db/ and distributed by update.

Entries are of the form:

# comment
host partpath type opt1=val1,opt2=val2 
host partpath type...

Supported types: ftree and simple.

Setting up ftree partitions
===========================

1. Determine how many files you want and:
Choose a depth of your tree d
Choose a width of your tree w.  w must a be a power of 2!!
You will have w^d "inodes" available.

2. Put 
host path ftree depth=d,width=w
in /vice/db/vicetab
on the SCM!!!

3. To install the skeleton:
touch path/FTREEDB
makeftree /vice/db/vicetab path

4. Fire up your server.
