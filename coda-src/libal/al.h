An ASCII representation of an access list. Begins with two decimal integers in format "%d\n%d\n"
specifying the number of Plus entries and Minus entries that follow.  This is followed by the list
of plus entries and then the list of minus entries.  Each entry consists of a
username or groupname followed by a decimal number representing the rights mask for that name.  Each
entry in the list looks as if it had been produced by printf() using a format list of "%s\t%d\n".

Note that the number of Plus entries and Minus entries must be less than AL_MaxExtEntries, which has
the default of AL_MAXEXTENTRIES. You can change this limit at any time by changing AL_MaxExtEntries.
