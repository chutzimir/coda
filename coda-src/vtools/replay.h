/* The following is taken from tar(5). */

/* The operation is effectively encoded in the linkflag field. */
/* We extend the use of this field to accommodate additional operations. */
/* The new encoding is: */
/*     '\0'  :  StoreData, Create */
/*     '1'  :  Link */
/*     '2'  :  Symlink */
/*     '3'  :  StoreStatus */
/*     '4'  :  Remove */
/*     '5'  :  Rename */
/*     '6'  :  Mkdir */
/*     '7'  :  Rmdir */

/* Notes: */
/*     1. Tar understands only codes '0', '1', '2'. */
/*     2. For rename, name :: to, linkname :: from. */
/*     3. Gid is normally -1.  Gid of 0 indicates name overflow. */
