.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBvenus\fR manages a cache of files and
directories for a client workstation.  It has a host of parameters
and configuration options.  Default values of everything are
compiled into \fBvenus\fR\&. Some of these are overridden
by the values in the \fBvenus.conf\fR file, provided
that it exists.  Both default and venus.conf values may be
overridden with command-line arguments.  Venus must be run as root.
.PP
The command-line options are:
.TP
\fB-k\fR
Take \fIkernel device\fR to be
the device for kernel/venus communication.

Default: \fB/dev/cfs0\fR
.TP
\fB-cf\fR
Limit the size of the file cache to \fIcache
files\fR entries.
.TP
\fB-c\fR
Limit the size of the file cache to \fIcache
blocks\fR 1K blocks.
.TP
\fB-mles\fR
Number of Client Modification Log entries.
.TP
\fB-vols\fR
Limit the size of the volume cache to
\fIvolumes\fR entries.
.TP
\fB-vsgs\fR
Limit the size of the VSG cache to
\fIvsgs\fR entries.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Initialize the debug level to \fIdebug
level\fR\&.

Default: \fB0\fR
.TP
\fB-f\fR
Take \fIcache directory\fR to be
the directory for the file, volume, and VSG caches.  On some
platforms \fBvenus\fR garbage collects any
files it doesnt recognize in the cache directory so use
caution when supplying this argument.

Venus will create the directory if it doesnt already
exist. The directory should have mode bits of
\fBrwx------\fR to protect the cache from
malicious local users.

Default: \fB/usr/coda/venus.cache\fR
.TP
\fB-m\fR
Controls what Coda Optimistic Protocol (COP) options
are enabled.  \fICOP modes\fR is
interpreted according to the following bit-mask: [ 
PIGGYCOP2 | ASYNCCOP2 | ASYNCCOP1 ].  Only some
combinations are legal.

Default: \fB[ PIGGYCOP2 | ASYNCCOP2 ]\fR
.TP
\fB-console\fR
Redirects console messages to \fIconsole
file\fR\&.

Default: \fB/dev/console\fR
.TP
\fB-retries\fR
Sets the number of RPC2 retries to \fIRPC2
retries\fR\&.

Default: \fB5\fR
.TP
\fB-timeout\fR
Sets the RPC2 timeout period to \fIRPC2
timeout\fR seconds.

Default: \fB15\fR
.TP
\fB-ws\fR
Sets the SFTP window size to \fISFTP window
size\fR packets.

Default: \fB8\fR
.TP
\fB-sa\fR
Sets the SFTP send ahead to \fISFTP send
ahead\fR packets.

Default: \fB4\fR
.TP
\fB-ap\fR
Sets the SFTP ack point to \fISFTP ack
point\fR packets.

Default: \fB4\fR
.TP
\fB-init\fR
Initializes (i.e., clears) file, volume, and VSG caches.
.TP
\fB-hdbes\fR
Number of hoard database entries.
.TP
\fB-rvmt\fR
Media that RVM resides on. Meaningful values are: 2
(use a file to persistently back RVM memory) and 3 (do not
use a file as RVM backing store, no persistency).
.TP
\fB-maxprefetchers\fR
Maximum number of threads doing prefetch ioctls.
.TP
\fB-maxworkers\fR
Number of worker threads.
.TP
\fB-maxcbservers\fR
Number of callback server threads.
.TP
\fB-vld\fR
Location of the venus log file or partition.

Default: \fB/usr/coda/LOG\fR
.TP
\fB-vlds\fR
Size of the log file or partition.
.TP
\fB-vdd\fR
Location of the venus data file or partition.

Default: \fB/usr/coda/DATA\fR
.TP
\fB-vdds\fR
Size of the data file or partition.
.TP
\fB-rdscs\fR
Specify RDS chunk size.
.TP
\fB-rdsnl\fR
Number of RDS nlists.
.TP
\fB-logopts\fR
Turn on log optimization.
.TP
\fB-swt\fR
Short term cache priority weight.
.TP
\fB-mwt\fR
Medium term cache priority weight.
.TP
\fB-ssf\fR
Short term cache scale factor.
.TP
\fBmount point\fR
Directory to serve as the mount point for Coda.

Default: \fB/coda\fR
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
Venus writes debugging information into the file
\fIcache directory\fR/venus.log. The verbosity
of this output is controlled by the \fIdebug
level\fR parameter.  High priority messages are
also written to the console (which may be redirected with the
console option at start-up).  Fatal errors will cause the internal
state of venus to be dumped to the log file, and a core file to be
left in \fIcache directory\fR/core.
.PP
Venus writes its process id into the file \fIcache
directory\fR/pid.  The
\fBvutil\fR(8)
program reads the pid file and dynamically alter Venus behavior by
sending signals to it.
.PP
Venus may be unable to unmount itself cleanly when it exits.
Usually this is due to processes which have references to vnodes in
the Coda namespace (e.g., a process is cd'ed somewhere in Coda).
Once these references are released, /coda can be unmounted.
