/*
 *    The purpose of cliques is to subset the modified objects of a volume into independent groups.
 *    This allows us to reduce the granularity of write-back.  Advantages of finer granularity include:
 *        1. shortening of transaction duration at servers
 *        2. more opportunity for "throttling" reintegration
 *        3. lower latency on revocation events
 *        4. less interference when multiple users are mutating in a volume
 *        5. lower-cost migration
 *        6. increased locality at servers
 *        7. easier incorporation into co-volumes?
 *
 *    Cliques add another level in the synchronization hierarchy.  We now have:
 *        1. Volumes
 *        2. Cliques
 *        3. Objects (fso's)
 *
 *    Clique write-back or flushing is caused by the following events:
 *        1. token revocation (from a server) for some object in the clique
 *        2. user conflict
 *           a) clique owner's auth tokens are about to expire or be flushed
 *           b) clique's owned by different user's need to be merged
 *        3. old-age: oldest operation associated with clique exceeds threshold
 *        4. communication state change --> reintegration
 *    Note that some of these (#1 and #3, I think) may involve partial flush of the clique.
 *
 *    A clique is meant to capture dependent sets of operations (and objects) in the manner of "precedence
 *    graphs" introduced by Davidson.  A clique consists of two sets:
 *        1. The transactions that comprise a sub-graph of the precedence graph
 *        2. The file system objects that are involved in those transactions
 *    By construction, an object can belong to at most one clique ("clean" objects belong to no clique).
 *
 *    Note that when disconnection occurs, unseen operations at the server(s) can make any objects in the
 *    volume dependent upon each other.  Therefore, upon disconnection we must merge all existing cliques
 *    (in a volume) and enter all further disconnected operations/objects in this single clique.  Since we wish
 *    to avoid inter-user dependencies during reintegration, we are forced to not only limit the transaction-
 *    owners of a single clique to one user, but to limit all of the cliques in a volume to one user.  This means
 *    (among other things) that situation 2b above can never occur.

 *
 *    Implementation of cliques, used in write-back and reintegration.
 *
 *    Every (mutating) transaction either:
 *        1. forms a new clique
 *        2. joins an existing clique
 *        3. merges two (or more) existing cliques
 *
 *    When preparing a new mutating transaction, the procedure is to derive the set of cliques corresponding
 *    to the objects involved in the transaction.  We switch on the cardinality of this set, C.
 *        - if |C| = 0, form a new clique consisting only of this transaction (and these objects)
 *        - if |C| = 1, add this transaction to the clique (and those of the objects that are not already members)
 *        - if |C| > 1, merge the cliques, and add this transaction (and any unaffiliated objects)
 *
 *    Note that for the "cancelling" operations, {StoreData, Unlink, Rmdir}, certain earlier transactions in the
 *    clique may be removed or modified.
 *
 *    Token revocation of some object in the clique (aka involuntary write-back) involves the following:
 *        - identify head transaction of clique for the requested object
 *        - compute the sequence of transactions that must be written back; this is the "prefix" which ends with
 *          the last transaction involving the requested object
 *        - write-back the prefix; note that tokens for objects other than the requested object must NOT be
 *          relinquished by the write-back except for objects that do not appear in the clique "suffix"
 *
 *    Auth token expiry/revocation of the clique owner forces write-back of the entire clique.
 *
 *    Age-driven write-back involves the prefix ending with the last "expired" transaction.  Note that, again,
 *    tokens for written-back objects can only be reliquished if the objects do not appear in the clique suffix.
 *
 *    Volume transition from hoarding to emulating state forces merge of all cliques in the volume.
