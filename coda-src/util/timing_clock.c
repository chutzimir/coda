 *  The following routines allow a user level program to read the

 *  device driver.  (Hence, without using a system call.)
 *
 *  The correct use of these routines requires that the user first
 *  call the open_timing_clock() routine.  Once this has completed
 *  successfully, the user has exclusive access of the DT2806 board.
 *  At this point, the user may call the read_timing_clock() routine
 *  any number of times to receive the current time.  When the user
 *  is finished, s/he MUST call the close_timing_clock() routine.
 *  This routine releases exclusive access of the DT2806 board and
 *  returns control of the board to the kernel.

 *     from having to use a system call.
 *
 *     The routine assumes that a cascade COULD occur in the
 *     middle of the reading and checks to make sure that such
 *     a time does not get reported to the user.  To ensure this,
 *     the routine reads the counter/timer values twice requiring
 *     the two most significant counter/timers to have the same
 *     values between reads (eg, value1.timer2 == value2.timer2)
 *     In addition, the routine requires that the second value
 *     of the least significant counter be greater than the first
 *     value of the least significant counter.  (This ensure a
 *     monitonically increasing time values on consecutive reads.)
