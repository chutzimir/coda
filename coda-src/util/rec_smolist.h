/*
 *
 * rec_smolist.h -- Specification of a recoverable singly-linked list type 
 * where list elements can be on only one list at a time.
 *
 * NOTE (Satya, 5/31/95)
 * ---------------------
 * The files util/rec_smolist.[ch] were originally called vol/recolist.[ch].
 * The original data structures  recolink and recolist are now
 * called rec_smolink and rec_smolist (for "small" olist and olink).   
 * No functional code changes have been made --- just systematic renaming.
 * 
 * This change was made to reduce confusion with rec_olist and rec_olink.
 * The rec_smo* data structures are very similar to the rec_o* data structures
 * except that the recoverable structures are smaller.  
 * rec_smolist occupies the size of one long  (pointer to the last element)
 * while rec_olist is 12 bytes long.  
 * These data structures were defined as part of a fix to the 
 * server a long time ago, avoiding re-initialization.
 * rec_smolist was designed to convert each volume's vnode array from an
 * array of pointers (each to a single vnode) to an array of lists of
 * vnodes without having to reinitialize the servers.  It is now
 * possible to have multiple vnodes with the same vnode number because
 * resolution can recreate a previously deleted vnode.
