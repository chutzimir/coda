       There should really be one such local per FILE * used, otherwise
       new date will appear on only one of the log files being used.
       I can't figure out how to do this cleanly, short of adding
       yet another required parameter or keeping a list of FILE *'s
       seen so far, and a separate oldyear and oldday for each. This
       seems overkill for now.
