/*
 *
 *    Specification of an abstract dictionary facility.
 *
 *    The main functionality provided by this package over a standard dictionary is
 *    reference counting of dictionary entries.  An entry is removed by invoking its
 *    "suicide" member, and then "releasing" the holder's reference by "putting" the
 *    object back into the dictionary.  When the last reference to a "dying" entry is
 *    released, the object will physically remove itself from the dictionary and invoke
 *    its destructor.
 *
 *    A "helper" class (assocrefs) is also provided which maintains variable-sized
 *    arrays of references to dictionary entries.  It is useful for maintaining complex
 *    relationships between entries of the same or different type.
 *
 *    Notes:
 *       1. This package steals ideas from NIHCL; I did not derive from its base classes
 *          because we would have to buy into the whole library, which is currently
 *          inconvenient.  Eventually, we should probably do that.
 *       2. there is currently no (package-supplied) way to avoid "getting" a dying entry
 *          out of the dictionary or waiting for it to actually die.
 *       3. the package is NOT multi-thread capable (except for coroutines, of course).
