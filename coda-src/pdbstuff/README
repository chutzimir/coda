To add new users
================

STEP I: Get a user id
---------------------
    o  Get a CS account for the new user(s).
    
       Coda login names and uids are same as on CS machines.




STEP II: Construct new vice.pdb and vice.pcf files
--------------------------------------------------
	
    o  cd to /coda/project/coda/src/db

    o  Append one line for each user to the file passwd.coda.

	Extract that line from /etc/passwd on some CMU-CS machine on which
        that user already has an account.  A simple way to find out such a
	machine is to "finger <<username>>@cs".
	
	Only the login name and uid are	relevant.  You can delete the other
        fields as long as you leave all the ":" characters intact.  
    
    o  Add the user's name to the groups he should belong to in
        file groups.coda.
       Note that Coda groups totally separate from  AFS groups and 
	CS unix groups.

       Exercise caution in adding a user to group System:Administrators.
       Only the hard core Coda developers should be in this group.
       
       Add all Coda developers (hard and soft core) to "System:coda".

       Add casual Coda users to "System:guests"
    
    o  Run "/usr/coda/bin/pwd2pdb -p passwd.coda -g groups.coda > vice.pdb"
    
    o  Run "/usr/coda/bin/pcfgen vice".  It will create a file vice.pcf.




STEP III: Install new vice.pdb and vice.pcf on servers
------------------------------------------------------
    o Telnet to SCM (currently scarlatti), login as rootl 

    o cd to /vice/db

    o Run "/usr/coda/bin/mvdb <srcdir> vice.pdb vice.pcf" where  <srcdir>
	is the name of the directory containing the new vice.pdb and vice.pcf.
	
      CAVEAT: using "cp" or "copy" instead of "mvdb" may cause servers to 
	die because of synchronization problems.  I believe using mvdb
        eliminates this, but let me know if there are still problems (Satya 2/12/93).

    o The vice.pdb and vice.pcf will get distributed to the other servers by the
	Update daemon eventually.  At that point all the file servers will know about
	the new users. 15-30 minutes is usually adequate for propagation.


STEP IV: Enable authentication of new users
-------------------------------------------
    o Get back to a Coda client.

    o Run "/usr/coda/bin/au -h mahler nu" once for each user.
       In response to prompts, provide your Coda userid and password,
          and then the new user's name and temporary password. (Give
	  the user's full name to the "Other info" prompt).

    o These updates will get distributed to the other servers by the
        Update daemon eventually.  

    o The auth server now knows about the new users.

    o New users can change their temporary passwords using "cpasswd".



STEP V: Creating volumes 
------------------------
    o Create one volume for each user and mount it as /coda/usr/<<username>>
