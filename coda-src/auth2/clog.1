.SH NAME
clog \- Authenticate to the Coda distributed file system
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBclog\fR [ \fB-pipe\fR ] [ \fB-test\fR ] [ \fB-host \fIhostname\fB\fR ] [ \fB-coda | -kerberos4 | -kerberos5\fR ] [ \fB-tofile \fIfile\fB\fR ] [ \fB-fromfile \fIfile\fB\fR ] \fB[username][@realm]\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This command enables users to get tokens to use for authenticated
communication with a Coda File System.  The given name and a password or
kerberos token are passed to an \fBAuthentication
Server\fR\&. The \fBAuthentication Server\fR returns
a set of tokens encoding the chosen identity if the password is correct.
\fBclog\fR passes these tokens to the
\fBvenus\fR process, which acts as the users agent for file
manipulation. These tokens have a limited lifetime, becoming invalid after
25 hours. If an attempt is made to operate on a Coda File System object
while the user is not authenticated, the user will assume the privileges
of the \fBAnonymous\fR user.
.PP
\fBclog\fR accepts the following arguments:
.TP
\fB-pipe\fR
For use in shell scripts, the password is read from stdin.
This option is also enabled when stdin is not a tty.
.TP
\fB-test\fR
Test the clog-venus token passing code.
.TP
\fB-host\fR
Specify the host where the authentication server is
running.
.TP
\fB-coda | -kerberos4 | -kerberos5\fR
Authentication mechanism, use kerberos tickets or coda
password to identify yourself to the authentication server.
.TP
\fB-tofile\fR
After obtaining a token from the authentication server,
write it to a file.
.TP
\fB-fromfile\fR
Instead of connecting to the authentication server, read a
previously saved token from a file and pass it to venus.
.TP
\fB[username][@realm]\fR
Coda user name you wish to be identified as within the
specified realm. If the username is not specified, clog tries to
use the local login name. If the Coda realm name is not specified
clog falls back to using the default realm name as specified in
the venus.conf configuration file.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The on-disk tokens are not encrypted.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The \fB-pipe\fR option should be dropped, there
already is an isatty(stdin) test which is sufficient for most
cases.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
The \fB-test\fR option should also test the
reading and writing code of token files.
