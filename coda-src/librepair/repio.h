/*  Directory repair data structures and routines 	

    A directory repair involves a list of individual repair operations.
    This list is constructed on the client and executed on the server.
    (In automated resolution, gets constructed on server)
    The repair is executed within a transaction at the server.
    struct repair defines one step in the repair.
    It should really be a union type but this is painful in C.
