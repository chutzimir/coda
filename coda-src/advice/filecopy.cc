/*  filecopy  --  copy a file from here to there
 *
 *  Usage:  i = filecopy (here,there);
 *	int i, here, there;
 *
 *  Filecopy performs a fast copy of the file "here" to the
 *  file "there".  Here and there are both file descriptors of
 *  open files; here is open for input, and there for output.
 *  Filecopy returns 0 if all is OK; -1 on error.
 *
 *  I have performed some tests for possible improvements to filecopy.
 *  Using a buffer size of 10240 provides about a 1.5 times speedup
 *  over 512 for a file of about 200,000 bytes.  Of course, other
 *  buffer sized should also work; this is a rather arbitrary choice.
 *  I have also tried inserting special startup code to attempt
 *  to align either the input or the output file to lie on a
 *  physical (512-byte) block boundary prior to the big loop,
 *  but this presents only a small (about 5% speedup, so I've
 *  canned that code.  The simple thing seems to be good enough.

 * 
 * 20-Nov-79  Steven Shafer (sas) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Rewritten for VAX; same as "filcopy" on PDP-11.  Bigger buffer
 *	size (20 physical blocks) seems to be a big win; aligning things
 *	on block boundaries seems to be a negligible improvement at
 *	considerable cost in complexity.
 *
 * 27-Mar-96  Maria Ebling (mre) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *      Use a smaller buffer (1K rather than 10K) so we don't overrun 
 *      the LWP stack!
