/* NOTE:
    Versions of RPC2 prior to May 28 1986 used random() for random number generation since it
    was supposed to generated more random sequences and allowed multiple sequence to coexist in
    non-interfering ways.  Unfortunately there seems to be a bug in random() that causes arbitrary
    bytes of memory to be clobbered.  This appeared in conjunction with Guardian and the bug fix
    for it caused other arbitrary bytes in RPC2 to be clobbered.
    
    Till someone can figure out what is wrong with random, we will use the old-fashioned but safer
    rand().  The code with NEWRANDOM ifdefs around it documents the changes.
