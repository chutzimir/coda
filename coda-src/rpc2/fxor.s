/* Fast exclusive-OR encryption routine.  Assumes that source, destination and key are fullword
	aligned, that the length to be encrypted is a multiple of 4 bytes, and source and destination
	are identical or disjoint (no overlap).  Also assumes key is 8 bytes long.
	NO CHECKING IS DONE.	CAVEAT CALLER!!

Called: 	fxor(a, b, c, d)
		R2: a = pointer to source
		R3: b = pointer to dest
		R4: c = length of data
		R5: d = pointer to key

The basic loop is unrolled so that 2 4-byte chunks are xored in each iteration.
R2 and R3 are always incremented, R4 is always decremented, and R5 is reset each time.
