/* Packet Format:
   =============

	Smart FTP is NOT built on top of RPC, but it does use RPC format packets for convenience

	The interpretation of header fields is similar to that in RPC:

		ProtoVersion	Set to SFTPVERSION; must match value at destination
		RemoteHandle	RPC Handle, at the packet destination, of the connection
					on whose behalf this file transfer is being performed
		LocalHandle	RPC Handle, at the packet source, of the connection
					on whose behalf this file transfer is being performed
		Flags		RPC2_RETRY and RPC2_ENCRYPTED have the usual meanings.
				SFTP_ACKME is also indicated here on data packets.

		<<< Fields below here encrypted on secure connections>>>
		BodyLength	Number of bytes in packet body
		SeqNumber	SFTP Sequence number with the following properties:
				    1. Data packets (Opcode SFTP_DATA) and control
					packets (all other opcodes) form different sequences.
					Each starts at 1 and monotonically increases by 1.
				    2. Every data packet is eventually acknowledged, but control
					packets need not always be acknowledged.
				    3. The client end and server ends each have their own, independent
					sequences.
				    4. There are thus 4 sequences in a connection:
					Client to Server, Data
					Client to Server, Control
					Server to Client, Data
					Server to Client, Control
				    5. The flow of packets is effectively viewed as a series of file
					transfers from client to server and vice versa, with control
					packets being merely annotations.  The boundary between file
					transfers is demarcated by a single data packet with the MOREDATA flag
					off.  The use of a separate, non-sparse sequence numbers for
					data is what allows the use of bitmasks.


		Opcode		SFTP Op code
		SEFlags		Flags meaningful to SFTP
		SEDataOffSet	#defined to GotEmAll;
					Makes sense only with opcode SFTP_ACK
					Highest seq number up to and including which all preceding
					data packets have been seen. Says nothing about control packets.
		SubsysId	Set to SMARTFTP always
		ReturnCode	#defined to BitMask0	(only sensible with SFTP_ACK)
					BitMask0..BitMask1 together form a bit string.
					1 bits indicate received packets with seq numbers greater than GotEmAll;
					Read left to right, bits correspond to GotEmAll+1, GotEmAll+2 ....
					Leftmost bit must be 0, by definition of GotEmAll
		Lamport		#defined to BitMask1    (only sensible with SFTP_ACK)
		Uniquefier	#defined to ThisCall    (RPC call sequence number at sending side
				    of the RPC pertaining to this side effect)
		TimeStamp
		BindTime        #defined to TimeEcho
		Body		Contains actual BodyLength bytes of file data;
				Used with SFTP_DATA and SFTP_START (for conveying SFTP address)

/* Per-LWP SFTP status information: accessed via LWP_SetRock() and LWP_GetRock() 

    Disclaimer (made in total disgust)
    =================================
	All this stuff dealing with SLSlots etc. is needed because the LWP
    package does not provide me with a very fundamental primitive: the ability to wait for
    an arbitrary event or a timeout.  This is apparently impossible to add in an efficient
    manner to the current LWP package.  So I have to fake this using the same strategy used in
    the base RPC2 (SLEntries for communication between SocketListener and the other LWPs).  The
    difference here is that the number of SLSlots is at most one per LWP, since an LWP can be
    waiting for at most one packet at a time.  The creation of an SLSlot for an LWP is 
    deferred until the first use of this mechanism, since we have no  way to gain control when 
    a LWP_CreateProcess() is done.
