/* Code to track host liveness */

/* 
We track liveness by host-portal pair, as we're really interested
in the liveness of the server process.  Response times are recorded
in the appropriate host-portal pair, and exported to applications.
This is similar to the "Lastword" shared between an RPC connection 
and its side effect.  However, unlike the "Lastword" sharing, these
times cannot be used to suppress retransmissions _between_ 
connections, because of the possibility of lost request packets.

Entries are kept in a hash table. Since most hosts have multiple
connections to a give server or service, and services are published
on certain well-known portal ids, we hash on a combination of the
low byte of the host address and the low byte of the portal.
Both are in network order, and are assumed to be numbers, not names.
