/* Code to track host liveness 

   We track liveness by host-portal pair, as we're really interested
   in the liveness of the server process.  Response times are recorded
   in the appropriate host-portal pair, and exported to applications.
   This is similar to the "Lastword" shared between an RPC connection
   and its side effect.  However, unlike the "Lastword" sharing, these
   times cannot be used to suppress retransmissions _between_
   connections, because of the possibility of lost request packets.

   Entries are kept in a hash table. Since most hosts have multiple
   connections to a give server or service, and services are published
   on certain well-known portal ids, we hash on a combination of the
   low byte of the host address and the low byte of the portal.  Both
   are in network order, and are assumed to be numbers, not names.  */
