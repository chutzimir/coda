/* Hash algorithm (courtesy Bob Sidebotham): Start table at
   INITHASHLENGTH and realloc() it, as needed, in powers of two upto
   MAXHASHLENGTH.  Use modulo function to compute hash value, but
   always do it modulo MAXHASHLENGTH, not modulo CurrentLength.  This
   guarantees that hash values will not change as table gets
   realloc()ed.  Computing modulo is cheap since MAXHASHLENGTH is a
   power of two ==> mask with (MAXHASHLENGTH-1).

   We avoid clashes altogether, since the legal input keys are always
   created by us.  If a potential handle would cause a clash, never
   allocate that handle, but try sequentially thereafter until a
   suitable one is found.  If a potential handle would yield a hash
   value in the region (MAXHASHLENGTH-CurrentLength), we have two
   choices: wrap around and try from the beginning or extend the
   hashtable to the next power of two.  Which one we choose depends on
   what fraction of the current slots are in use.  If this is high we
   realloc; else we wrap around.

   Limitations: this hash table can allocate at most MAXHASHLENGTH
   conncurrent connections; over the life of the program, however, at
   most 2**30 entries can be allocated before connection ids wrap
   around via 0.  */

/* Code to Map Retried Bind Requests to Existing Connections  */

/* All packets other than Init1 requests have a LocalHandle field
which is valid.  On Init1 we do not have a local handle yet.  Each
Init1 packet and its retries have a truly random Uniquefier, generated
by the client.  The retries also have the RETRY bit set in the packet
headers.  The triple (Host,Portal,Uniquefier) is totally unique even
across client reboots.
    
In the worst case the mapping involves a linear search of the
connection list.  With 1000 connections this took about 60
milliseconds on a SUN2.  In practice, many of these connections will
not be server-end connections so the test will be shorter.  However,
to speed up the lookup we use a trivial LRU cache of recent bind
completions.  The RBCache is essentially a way to focus attention on a
small subset of the entire connection list.

To conserve storage we allocate the RBCache only if the number of
connections exceeds a certain threshold.  Setting RPC2_Small
suppresses the RBCache mechanism altogether.

If this doesn't work well enough we may have to go to a hash table
data structure that maps each (host, portal, uniquefier) triple to a
connection handle.  That will almost certainly be more complex to
build and maintain.  */
