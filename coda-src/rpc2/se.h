				    off piggybacking in SFTP_Initializer by setting DoPiggy to 0.
				    
				    NOTE:  (2/6/1994, Satya) The semantics is being slightly changed
				    here to support partial file transfer; it used to be the case
				    that hitting ByteQuota was an error reported as RPC2_SEFAIL1.
				    But no one seems to be relying on this, so changing the error
				    return to a success return seems fair game.
