/* This is a revamp of the Coda error handling. Aims and constraints:
   - errors returned by RPC's are platform independent. Ports to other
     platforms have made it mandatory to instate this without delay. 
   - there is room to accomodate Coda specific errors (like VSALVAGE)
     as well as system errors.
   - we want quick and easy translation of errors:
     a) from Coda to system errors (typically for clients)
     b) from system to Coda errors (typically for servers)
     c) we want "perror" like functions to save time in coding
   - Coda servers should only return errors which all of the client
     platforms can handle. 
   - If errors arrive on certain clients/servers and are not recognized
     a serious log message is printed and a default error is code
     is returned.
