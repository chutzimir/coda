	* Removed a bunch of unused code.
	* Hierarchical file cache for Coda clients (Phil Nelson).
	* Lazy creation of hierachical directory trees (Phil Nelson).
	* Fixes to cure needless refetching of weakly reintegrated files.

        * ======== Release 5.3.5 =========
        * Lots of fixes for Solaris sparc & i386 (Phil Nelson).
        * CML entries were not frozen during trickle reintegration and repair
        * sessions. This lead to problems with failed backfetches, bad

        * cfs rmm didn't inform the kernel that the directory was gone.
        * Broken inet_aton check in configure caused gethostbyname crashes on
          FreeBSD (Shafeeq).
        * New code-paths in sftp (as of the last release) turned up some bugs.
        * Shadowing the container file `V0' copied its contents to `V0',
          actually losing the data during the copy (Shafeeq).
        * Moved default location of venus.log to /usr/coda/etc.
        * Fixed double free of sftp packets on disk errors.
        * Fixed up missing shadow files and making backups of owrite files to
          /usr/coda/spool during venus startup/recovery.
        * cfs forcereintegrate should now work correctly (Shafeeq).
        * Bad COP2 handling lead to undetected server-server conflicts.
        * Several weak-reintegration problems fixed.
        * Weak reintegration marked the wrong objects as needing resolution.
        * Repair didn't freeze CML entries during reintegration, and failed to
          correctly copy filedata when preserving a store operation.
	* -mapprivate flag for norton (Phil Nelson).

1999-12-31    <jaharkes@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Fixed a crash on 'cfs rmm dir/'
	* Skipping non-cacheable objects during the hoard walk.
	* Got rid of a double free (and crash) in the sftp code.

	* Build cleanups, moved kernel-src and lwp to separate packages.
	* Switched codaservers to exit by default, added a -zombify flag and
	  test for /vice/srv/ZOMBIFY to switch back to the endless sleep.
	* Cleanups in backup and setup scripts. (Kurt Huwig and David J. Graff)
	* Added more options for venus.conf.
	* Added support for multi-level incremental backups.
	* Fixed resolving the parent directory when GetAttr fails.
	* Fixed SetACL problem where an invalid username would result in the
	  acl for user `0' to be added.
	* Fixed losing files (and possible crash) during venus startup after a
	  file was opened for writing during reintegration (shadowing).
	* Fixed losing filedata when a file gets shadowed twice. 
	* Didn't resolve the directory owner when doing log based resolution.

1999-10-21    <jaharkes@cs.cmu.edu>
	* ======== Release 5.3.3 =========
	* Dumpdir argument of the backup program was not considered optional.
	* Skip invalid lines while parsing the VSGDB. 
	* Build cleanup, now correctly builds vcrcommon.h.
	* Setattr sometimes wanted fso data even when it was not required.

	    - A memory leak was triggered by failing SFTP transfers, this has
	      been partially fixed.
	    - Fixed a crash that occured after a double kill of a namecontext
	      during a hoard walk after token expiry.
	    - Collapsed hoard namecontexts were never re-expanded due to some
	      optimizations.
	* Cleanups & features:
	    - Thanks to a huge patch from Jozsef Kadlecsik, many #ifdef's in
	      the code are now based on autoconf detected features instead of
	      operating system.
	    - Reworked the init scripts a bit.
	    - New configuration file, $sysconfdir/coda/venus.conf, which
	      allows persistent changes to rvm/logfiles/cache directory
	      locations, which should allow distributions to push Coda into
	      their standard directory hierarchy.
	    - Fixed a (false) conflict that was created after a token expired.
	    - Several compiler errors/warnings fixed, thanks to Troy
	      Benjegerdes and Kurt Garloff.
	    - Phil Nelson has been making many fixes and updates for the
	      Solaris port.

	* Servers would assert when they got a connection from an unknown
	  userid.
	* Codacon couldn't bind to venus if only the loopback device was
	  available.
	* Added libdb2 detection, as it isn't 1.85 compatible (fileformat).
	* Reshuffled the tree a bit

	  (still not completely done yet).
	* Reduced server retry timeout to max. 15 seconds.
	* Finish trickle stores when switching to strong, instead of
	  resending the complete file.

	  overall.
	* Removes venus reinitialization when installing a new rpm.
	* Fixes several directory refcounting problems in the server.
	

1999-03-04    <jaharkes@cs.cmu.edu>

	* Our Win95 inet_aton function didn't return an error when it was
	  given an invalid IP address.
	* Fixed a bug in auth2/auser.c, FQDN got mistaken for an IP-address.

	* The development branch contains numerous cleanups and fixes, the
	  important ones are listed below.
	- New directory handling code, which does not corrupt the directory
	  structures on the server and has better `bad-directory' checking and
	  handling code.
	- New RTT and bandwidth estimates in the rpc2 code, currently these
	  estimates are used by SFTP and venus, RPC2 itself remains to be
	  converted to the new scheme. Little timing/correctness errors were
	  fixed.
	- Incorporates patches to build a win95 client with all the little
	  apps around it (clog, cfs, etc.).
	* and more....

1998-12-10    <braam@cs.cmu.edu>
        
	* removed usage of FT_AGetTimeOfDay which caused confusing RTT
	  observations.

1998-10-27    <jaharkes@cs.cmu.edu>

	* fixed null-pointer deref in multi-rpc tracing code.
	* 2 lwp's could gain access to the same exclusive write lock, this

	* ======== Release 4.6.3 =========
	* Removed some network flooding avoidance mechanism which caused SFTP
	to work at 100KB/s on high bandwidth/low latency networks (100Base-T).
	* When a volume is not automatically salvage-able, ALL errors are
	reported instead of one. This is helpful when attempting to repair
	by hand.
	* Fix for norton, recreate a directory entry for some file.
	* Modified coda.spec to _not_ to create the /usr/bin/tixwish softlink.

1998-07-14    <jaharkes@telos.odyssey.cs.cmu.edu>

	* ======== Release 4.6.2 =========
	* coda-src/rpc2: Small piggybacked fragments were rejected by venus.
	* coda-src/scripts/venus-setup: Creates /coda/tmp as well.

	for out-of-bounds array accessing. Corrected off-by-one iterator
	error.
	* kernel-src/vfs/linux21: Lots of fixes.

1998-06-30    <jaharkes@telos.odyssey.cs.cmu.edu>

	Makefiles for the linux-coda module.  Improvements to the 
	kernel code. 
	* coda-src/fail: filcon now returns 0. 
	* minor changes for BSD package building.

1998-06-18    <braam@carissimi.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* kernel-src/vfs/Makefile.in (SUBDIRS): linux kernel code builds
 	no longer part of Coda building. Too many deps on kernel
 	flags. This has implications for the coda.spec.in file too.
	* lib-src/mlwp/lwp.c: stacks are now mmapped with guard pages.
	* rvm-src/rvm/rvm_logrecovr.c: two important bugs were caught in a 
	large scale debugging effort.  They both resulted from the rvm
	thread not correctly signalling the other threads in case the log
	was empty but recover was triggered because a large transaction
	was pending. Servers now startup fine, even first time around.
	
1998-06-16  Peter Braam  <braam@motet.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* rvm-src/rvmlwp and rdslwp: Jan fixed building RVM inside the
	source tree 
	* coda-src/vice/srv.cc: moved RVM initialization before RPC2
	startup. 
	* coda-src/scripts/vutil & venus: Jan: improve signal handling,
	vutil now  changes the debug level correctly on Linux (at last)
	* coda-src/vice/srvproc2.cc: Shafeeq and Peter: more changes to
	connection setup in the server.
	
1998-06-11  Peter Braam  <braam@motet.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* kernel-src/vfs/linux21/psdev.c Moved entry for /proc/fs to the
	proc filesystem directory.  
	* kernel-src/vsf/linux21/dir.c: fixed the nasty segfault caused by
	positive error return in coda_lookup. Cleaned up the interruption
	code.  

1998-06-06  Peter Braam  <braam@motet.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* coda-src/scripts/venus-setup: chmod 600 /dev/cfs0 !!!
	* coda-src/venus/vproc.h: for Linux CRTORUID for Linux should use
	fsuid. This allows Samba exporting of /coda 

1998-06-03  Peter Braam  <braam@motet.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* Fix to BOGUS/NAKIT macros. There are many unsafe macros in rpc2.
	These are the most important ones and we have made them safe.  This
	was responsible for numerous errors.

1998-05-27    <braam@carissimi.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* rvm-src/configure.in/Makeconf: revamped the building process
	of the threaded rvm/rds libraries to stop using symbolic links.
	* volutil/vol-setlogparms.cc: VMRES flag was made obsolete, and 
	"or-ing" the flags changed to assignment.

1998-05-18    <braam@ptar.stelias.com>

	* got rid of /vice/db/hosts.  Names in /vice/db/servers
	must now be equal to those in the VSGDB. This involved minor
	changes in vol/volume.cc
	* changed SIGSTP to SIGUSR and added a routine UtilDetach which
	does setsid  to: updatesrv, updateclnt, auth2. 
	* changed srv to codasrv
	* vice-setup-rvm exits if srv.conf exists

1998-05-14    <braam@carissimi.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* increased the stack of advice_daemon in Venus to 0x4000. Stack
	overflow was caused by several char[MAXPATHLEN] on the stack. 
	* increased the stacksize of various things in advice_srv
	* asked advice_srv to exit if Gui falls over
	* Fixed some missing code in advice/conversions.cc
	* Guidir: beginning of better handling of PATHS and 
	GetServerInformation. advice_srv now works .. at CMU for Peter...
	* Makeconf Eliots problem with VPATH/INCLFLAGS. fixed.
	* lwp.c correct initialization of lwp_logfile.

	* ======== Release 4.6.0 =========
	* lib-src/mlwp: patches added from Odyssey group to aid in
	debugging stack problems.
	* added LWP_SetLog file to set log file and level.
	* coda-src/rpc2, rp2gen: changes from Odyssey: change time 
	measurement units to ms from 10ms; add float type to XDR.
	* included shrink packet bug fix 
	* CODA_ASSERT: changed to while (1) { sleep(1); } to preserve more
	stack. 
	* C++/C: we upgraded libal and auth2 and vicedep to "C". All stub
	will now appear with C linkage (rules for C++ stub code were
	removed). 
	* Changed logging in RPC2 to use a log file rather than stdout. 
	* rvm-src/seg/rvm_loadseg.c: initialized the hdr_vmaddr pointer to 
	NULL. 
	* coda-src/venus/vproc.h: use euid instead of fsuid.  This allows
	samba to export /coda to my windows machine and I can save files
	directly into Coda.
	* coda-src/vice/srvproc.cc ViceNewConnection violated RPC2
	semantics by making a long running call to set up a callback
	connection with Venus.  This resulted in Venus retransmitting
	packets. We moved this setup to ViceNewConnectFS. 
	* kernel-src/vfs/linux21: added /proc entries in /proc/fs/coda
	showing statistics.  Fixed a bug in flag_children (dereferenced a
	NULL in a printk statement).  Took care of O_RDONLY == 0
	(i.e. it's not a bit which is set).
	* coda-src/advice: the Coda console is still not operational
	* coda-src/portmapper: a simple portmapper has been added. We will
	start using this in the future. 
	* coda-src/rpc2/sl.c: ShrinkPacket -- this contained a nasty bug.
	If a  packet was sent with a wrong length field in it a random pointer
	to a buffer may have been returned.  This whole area needs more
	revisiting. 
	* coda-src/scripts/startserver: makes a backup copy of
	SrvErr. Starts the server with the -debarrenize flag to avoid
	silly salvage problems.
	* vice.init: split up into 3 scripts for auth2, update and the
	server. Should now also stop these correctly.  Did away with
	STARTFROMBOOT for Linux.     
	* lwp.c: changed the Logging of errors to write to a FILE
	*lwp_logfile. LWP_SetLog can set this file and the debug
	level. 
	* sys/....h: Bob Baron changed a few header orders for
	compilation on recent FreeBSD's.
	* kernel-src/vfs/linux21: important bug fix -- the VATRR flag
	was cleared instead of set in file_write. Fixed.
	* added suitable RVM addresses for Sparc 1+ machines running
	Linux. 
	* Increased the stack size in the PollServer thread in
	backup.
