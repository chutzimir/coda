1998-06-16  Peter Braam  <braam@motet.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* rvm-src/rvmlwp and rdslwp: Jan fixed building RVM inside the source tree
	* coda-src/vice/srv.cc: moved RVM initialization before RPC2 startup.
	* coda-src/scripts/vutil & venus: Jan: improve signal handling, vutil now 
	changes the debug level correctly on Linux (at last)
	* coda-src/vice/srvproc2.cc: Shafeeq and Peter: more changes to connection
	setup in the server.
	
1998-06-11  Peter Braam  <braam@motet.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* kernel-src/vfs/linux21: the volroot list off the superblock was
 	being corrupted with stale entries. Fixed.  Also refresh the
 	opened container inode upon every open.

1998-06-07    <braam@carissimi.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* kernel-src/vfs/linux21/psdev.c Moved entry for /proc/fs to the
	proc filesystem directory.  
	* kernel-src/vsf/linux21/dir.c: fixed the nasty segfault caused by
	positive error return in coda_lookup. Cleaned up the interruption
	code.  

1998-06-06  Peter Braam  <braam@motet.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* coda-src/scripts/venus-setup: chmod 600 /dev/cfs0 !!!
	* coda-src/venus/vproc.h: for Linux CRTORUID for Linux should use
	fsuid. This allows Samba exporting of /coda 

1998-06-03  Peter Braam  <braam@motet.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* Fix to BOGUS/NAKIT macros. There are many unsafe macros in rpc2.  These are the 
	most important ones and we have made them safe.  This was responsible for numerous
	errors.

1998-05-27    <braam@carissimi.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* rvm-src/configure.in/Makeconf: revamped the building process
	of the threaded rvm/rds libraries to stop using symbolic links.
	* volutil/vol-setlogparms.cc: VMRES flag was made obsolete, and 
	"or-ing" the flags changed to assignment.

1998-05-18    <braam@ptar.stelias.com>

	* got rid of /vice/db/hosts.  Names in /vice/db/servers
	must now be equal to those in the VSGDB. This involved minor
	changes in vol/volume.cc
	* changed SIGSTP to SIGUSR and added a routine UtilDetach which
	does setsid  to: updatesrv, updateclnt, auth2. 
	* changed srv to codasrv
	* vice-setup-rvm exits if srv.conf exists

1998-05-14    <braam@carissimi.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* increased the stack of advice_daemon in Venus to 0x4000. Stack
	overflow was caused by several char[MAXPATHLEN] on the stack. 
	* increased the stacksize of various things in advice_srv
	* asked advice_srv to exit if Gui falls over
	* Fixed some missing code in advice/conversions.cc
	* Guidir: beginning of better handling of PATHS and 
	GetServerInformation. advice_srv now works .. at CMU for Peter...
	* Makeconf Eliots problem with VPATH/INCLFLAGS. fixed.
	* lwp.c correct initialization of lwp_logfile. 

1998-05-01    <braam@carissimi.coda.cs.cmu.edu>

	* ======== Release 4.6.0 =========
	* lib-src/mlwp: patches added from Odyssey group to aid in
	debugging stack problems.
	* added LWP_SetLog file to set log file and level.
	* coda-src/rpc2, rp2gen: changes from Odyssey: change time 
	measurement units to ms from 10ms; add float type to XDR.
	* included shrink packet bug fix 
	* assert: changed to while (1) { sleep(1); } to preserve more
	stack. 
	* C++/C: we upgraded libal and auth2 and vicedep to "C". All stub
	will now appear with C linkage (rules for C++ stub code were
	removed). 
	* Changed logging in RPC2 to use a log file rather than stdout. 
	* rvm-src/seg/rvm_loadseg.c: initialized the hdr_vmaddr pointer to 
	NULL. 
	* coda-src/venus/vproc.h: use euid instead of fsuid.  This allows
	samba to export /coda to my windows machine and I can save files
	directly into Coda.
	* coda-src/vice/srvproc.cc ViceNewConnection violated RPC2
	semantics by making a long running call to set up a callback
	connection with Venus.  This resulted in Venus retransmitting
	packets. We moved this setup to ViceNewConnectFS. 
	* kernel-src/vfs/linux21: added /proc entries in /proc/fs/coda
	showing statistics.  Fixed a bug in flag_children (dereferenced a
	NULL in a printk statement).  Took care of O_RDONLY == 0
	(i.e. it's not a bit which is set).
	* coda-src/advice: the Coda console is still not operational
	* coda-src/portmapper: a simple portmapper has been added. We will
	start using this in the future. 
	* coda-src/rpc2/sl.c: ShrinkPacket -- this contained a nasty bug.
	If a  packet was sent with a wrong length field in it a random pointer
	to a buffer may have been returned.  This whole area needs more
	revisiting. 
	* coda-src/scripts/startserver: makes a backup copy of
	SrvErr. Starts the server with the -debarrenize flag to avoid
	silly salvage problems.
	* vice.init: split up into 3 scripts for auth2, update and the
	server. Should now also stop these correctly.  Did away with
	STARTFROMBOOT for Linux.     
	* lwp.c: changed the Logging of errors to write to a FILE
	*lwp_logfile. LWP_SetLog can set this file and the debug
	level. 
	* sys/....h: Bob Baron changed a few header orders for
	compilation on recent FreeBSD's.
	* kernel-src/vfs/linux21: important bug fix -- the VATRR flag
	was cleared instead of set in file_write. Fixed.
	* added suitable RVM addresses for Sparc 1+ machines running
	Linux. 
	* Increased the stack size in the PollServer thread in
	backup.
