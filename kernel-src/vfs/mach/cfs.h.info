INIT_IN: macro
	Fills in opcode, pid, pgid, and credential of inputArgs
        Called by anyone making an upcall to Venus
        Calls no one

INIT_OUT: macro
	Fills in opcode, result, of outputArgs
	Not used in kernel
	Calls no one

VC_IN_NO_DATA: macro         (XXX - may ignore padding on Alpha)
	Sum of sizes of each required field in inputArgs
	Used multiple places
	Calls no one

VC_OUT_NO_DATA: macro        (XXX - may ignore padding on Alpha)
	Sum of sizes of each required field in outputArgs
	Used in VC_OUTSIZE and in cfs_vnodeops when we aren't getting
	return values (setattr & access)

VC_INSIZE(member): macro
	Given which of the union members we are using, calculates
        total size of an inputArgs structure to pass.
	Used for many upcalls
	Calls no one

VC_OUTSIZE(member): macro	
	Given which of the union members we are using, calculates
        total size of an outputArgs structure to recieve.
	Used for many upcalls
	Calls no one

VC_SIZE(member): macro
	Used only by venus

* These are used for communications queues between venus/kernel

  INIT_QUEUE(q): macro
	  initializes a struct queue.  

  GETNEXT(q): macro
	  head of a request/reply queu

  EMPTY(q): macro
	  is the queue empty

  EOQ(elt,q): macro
	  is elt first on the queu

  INSQUE(elt,q): macro
	  insert elt into the queue

  REMQUE(q): macro
	  remove tail from the queue

VC_OPEN(struct vcomm *vcp): macro
	True iff the message queues in the comm structures are
        initialized 
        Used to check that Venus is alive, etc.

MARK_VC_CLOSED(vcp): macro
	Clear indication that the VC is open.
	Used in vc_nb_close

ADD_VFS_TO_MNTINFO(struct cfs_mntinfo *mi, VFS_T *vfsp, struct vnode *vp)
	Adds a (vfs,root-vnode) pair to the list of fs's known by the
	coda pseudo-device.
	Called from cfs_mount (netbsd+mach) and findTome (mach only
        for now, findTome is called by namei)

CFS_MOUNTED(VFS_T *vfsp): macro
	True if and only if something is stored on the private area of
        the VFS pointer.
	Used by cfs_mount and cfs_unmount, just to make sure.

IS_CTL_NAME(dvp, name): macro
	True if dvp is the root vnode of /coda and name is ".CONTROL"
	
IS_CTL_FID(fidp): macro 
	True if fid is -1.-1.-1

ISDIR(fid): macro
	True if fid's vnode is odd

CFSDEBUG(N, STMT): macro
	do STMT only if bit N is set in cfsdebug
