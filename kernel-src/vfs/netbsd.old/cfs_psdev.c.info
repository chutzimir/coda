XXX - why isn't device checking a subroutine?

***** vc_nb_open()

Arguments:
	A device to open
	flags (unused)
	mode (unused)
	process pointer

If minor number is more than the # of minor devices or negative
	return ENXIO
Initialize namecache, control fid if necessary (calling makecfsnode)
Ensure no one else has the device open
Mark the device as the "regular" coda device (i.e. not a tome)
Zero out the mount information.


***** vc_nb_close()

Arguments:
	A device to close
	unused flag, mode, process pointer

Check minor number of device
Panic if device not already open
Free name if it's allocated (i.e. it's a tome)
Unmount each VFS hanging off this device.  (Can there ever be more
                                             than one?)
Wake up any clients sleeping on request/reply queues, so they can return.


***** vc_nb_read

Arguments:
	A device on which to read
	a uio structure
	an (unused) flag word

Check the device number
If nothing to read, return zero.
Copy out the first request to the uiop, and remove it from the request
   queue.
If we aren't SIGNALing the venus, expect a reply from this message.


***** vc_nb_write

Arguments:
	Same as read

Check the device number.
Grab the opcode, uniqifier pair
If the opcode is a downcall, grab the rest of the downcall, and
	call handleDownCall (in cfs_subr.c) and return
Find the message to which we are expecting a reply
Copy in the rest of the reply
Wake up the process that slept on this request in cfscall.


***** vc_nb_ioctl

XXX - we need to check that the minor device is okay, and that
      the device is open, and whatever else.

The ioctl arguments are defined in cfsio.h

Four ioctls:
	CFSRESIZE
		Calls cfsnc_resize with the argument.

	CFSSTATS
		Calls cfsnc_gather_stats()

	CFSPRINT
		Calls print_cfsnc()

	ODYBIND
		Identifies a name (type) with this device.


***** vc_nb_select

Check device minor number
If flag isn't FREAD return 0 (not ready)  (XXX - that can't be right!)
If the requests queue isn't empty return 1 (ready)
Record the selector and return 0 (not ready)
