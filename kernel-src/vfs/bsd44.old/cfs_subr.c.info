--Make a call up to Venus.

Ensure that the device is open for this call (i.e.: venus is around)
Set up the message buffer, and tag the inputArgs with the uniqifier
Enqueue the mesasge
Wakeup Venus to read the message.
Go to sleep; wait for the corresponding write to wake up.
If Venus is alive
	and the request was made and responded to
		record how big it was
		fall through
	and the request was never made
		pull the request off the queue
		set error to EINTR
		fall through
	and the request was made, but not responded to
		Send venus a signal to ignore it.  (At head of Q)
		set error to EINTR
If Venus died return ENODEV
return

XXX NOTE: we need to try to use vnode_uncache_try rather than
inode_uncache_try.

***** handleDownCall

This function deals with requests from Venus.  It's called by
vc_nb_write when Venus writes a packet that is tagged with a downcall
opcode.  There are currently six downcalls.  They are described in the
source, but that description is repeated here.

/*
 * There are 6 cases where invalidations occur. The semantics of each
 * is listed here.
 *
 * CFS_FLUSH     -- flush all entries from the name cache and the cnode cache.
 * CFS_PURGEUSER -- flush all entries from the name cache for a specific user
 *                  This call is a result of token expiration.
 *
 * The next two are the result of callbacks on a file or directory.
 * CFS_ZAPDIR    -- flush the attributes for the dir from its cnode.
 *                  Zap all children of this directory from the namecache.
 * CFS_ZAPFILE   -- flush the attributes for a file.
 *
 * The fifth is a result of Venus detecting an inconsistent file.
 * CFS_PURGEFID  -- flush the attribute for the file
 *                  If it is a dir (odd vnode), purge its 
 *                  children from the namecache
 *                  remove the file from the namecache.
 *
 * The sixth allows Venus to replace local fids with global ones
 * during reintegration.
 *
 * CFS_REPLACE -- replace one ViceFid with another throughout the name cache

CFS_FLUSH and CFS_PURGEUSER have their own functions, described below.
