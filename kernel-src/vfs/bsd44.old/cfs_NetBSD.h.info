DO_LOOKUP: macro

	Used lots of places.

COPY_CRED_TO_CODACRED: macro
	They are defined to be the same, just an assignment.
	Used mostly in passing credentials up to Venus.

VFS_FSID    macros
VFS_BSIZE
	Selectors for fields of a VFS_T structure.
	Used everywhere.

VFS_INIT: macro
	Set the operations vector and private data of a VFS_T
        structure.
	Used only in findTome.

VN_VFS   macros
VN_TYPE
VN_RDEV
	Selectors for fields of a struct vnode.
	Used everywhere

VTOC    macros
CTOV
	Convert between cnodes and vnodes

CNODE_NEXT(cp): macro
	Yeild the next cnode on a linked list of cnodes.

DOUNMOUNT(vfsp): macro
	Call dounmount (post-namei portion of unmount())
	Called by vc_nb_close (closing of the pseudo-device cluster)

CN_INIT(cp): macro
	bzero a cnode.
	called by cfs_alloc
	
CNODE_COUNT(cp): macro      (XXX This is definitely wrong.)
	Returns the reference count of a vnode

VNODE_VM_INFO_INIT: macro
	Empty: used only by Mach.

SYS_VN_INIT(struct cnode *cp, VFS_T *vfsp, unused type): macro
	Calls getnewvnode, then points the vnode and cnode at each
        other.  (returned with usecount = 1);
	called by makecfsnode

VN_HOLD(vp): macro       (XXX -bad! bnoble)
	Increment refcount on vp
	Called everywhere.

VN_RELE(vp): macro       (XXX -bad! bnoble)
	Decrement refcount on vp, inactive/freelist if zero
	Called everywhere

SELWAKEUP(selproc): macro
	Wakes up process waiting on select (via selwakeup)
	Called in cfscall.

SELRECORD(selinfo): macro
	Remember that current process wants to select
	Called in vc_nb_select

WAKEUP(cond): macro   (XXX - is this the right thing?)
	Calls wakeup() on the condition.
	Called in vc_nb_close and vc_nb_write

SLEEP(cond): macro
	Calls tsleep on the condition.
	Called in cfscall, when the kernel thread is calling up to
        venus (write by venus down to kernel wakes back up.)

CFS_ALLOC(ptr, cast, size): macro
	Calls malloc; general purpose alloction.  Tagged as M_CFS.
	Used lots of places

CFS_FREE(ptr, size): macro
	Frees memory allocated by CFS_ALLOC.

	
COMPLAIN_BITTERLY(): macro
	Moan about using a dead cnode.  Should be stripped out.
