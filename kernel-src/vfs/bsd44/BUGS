		RELEASE c4_3_14

key:
	Cx	- client bugs
	Kx	- kernel bugs
	Sx	- server bugs

-------------------------------------------------------------------
C1.
  BUG:
	There are locking problems that might be exacerbated if you allow
	automatic hoard walks.
  WORKAROUND:
	for now do a
		hoard off
	to inhibit automatic hoard updates

-------------------------------------------------------------------
S1.
  BUG:
	The server has been known to occassionally not start.
  WORKAROUND:
	Just keep trying.
  REQUEST:
	If you can make this happen repeatably let us know.

S2.
  BUG:
	The freebsd server has not been tested with log and data
	files on a raw partition.
  WORKAROUND:
	If raw partitions do not work, fall back to using files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
K1.
  BUG:
	^c and ^z do not work when a process access a file in coda
  WORKAROUND:
	NONE
  FIX:
	There will be a fix for the next release.  The simplest fix
	works in all cases except for emacs ;-(  To get emacs right
	will require implementing analagous to signanosleep()

K2.
  BUG:
	Killing venus (either kill -9 or vutil -shutdown) may not succeed
	and if it does venus may lock if it is restarted.
  WORKAROUND:
	For now be prepared to reboot if you do either of the above.
	I believe that NetBSD 1.2 is most likely to successfully restart
	and the other two platforms need some work.
  FIX:
	There are at least two problems, I am aware of that will be fixed
	in the next release.  But there may be more.

K3.
  BUG:
	df and mount do not show coda.
  WORKAROUND:
  FIX:
	Will be fixed in the next release.
