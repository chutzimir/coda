***************

ifs kernel code.

Makefile	: Linux makefile.
Makefile.root	: Sample linux source Makefile.
ifssyscall.c	: Kernel code for IFS.
inode_io.c	: Entry point for sys_inode_io.c (Kept separate for modules).
ifs.h		: Header file for IFS (should be place in include/linux).

To allow compilation as a module, two files were created.

ifssyscall.c	: Contains the inode_io code.
inode_io.c	: Contains the sys_inode_io entry point.

The easiest way to get this working is to edit the following files:

kernel/ksyms.c 	:	add an entry X(kern_inode_io)
arch/i386/kernel :	add an entry X(inode_io)

Copy ifs.h to include/linux.

Edit the root Makefile to compile and link inode_io.c into the kernel,
and ifssyscall.c as a module.  There is a sample Makefile.root to show
how I did this here.
