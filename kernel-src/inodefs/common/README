This directory should contain files
that related to inodefs but are platform
independent.  I expect there to be two
such files:
  inodefs.h 	which defines a fixed interface
		(regardless of kernel on library
		implementation of inodefs)

  libinodefsulib.a the library implmementation
		of the inodefs

Right now, the Makefile only installs inodefs.h.
It should be fixed to build libinodefsulib.a also,
and to do so for all platforms (not just linux).

Fix this soon!  (Satya, 1/27/97)
