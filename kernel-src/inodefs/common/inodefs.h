/* Interface definition for inode operations; the definition is 
   identical for both kernel and user-level implementations of
   these operations.  Also includes interface definitions for a 
   few Coda-specific system calls like pioctl() and setpag().

   This file gets installed in include, and used in the 
   compilation of kernel-src as well as coda-src.  I expect quite
   a few more definitions to end up here eventually.
