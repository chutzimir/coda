Inodefs
-------

For high performance you may want to implement a new set of system
calls accessing inodes directly on disk.  To make this a recognized
partition type proceed as follows:

0. naming: 

 - the names iopen, icreate etc. may not be used for system
calls. They are defined in coda-src/partition/inodeops.c and fish up
the correct method based on the partition type (found by device
number). So name your routines something like raw_iopen etc.

 
Implementation:

1. put kernel code here.  

2. in coda-src/kerndeps make a user level library for these system
calls, say YOURsyscalls.a

3. in coda-src/partition build a YOURifs.c and YOURifs.h file,
exporting a structure of type inodeops

4. make sure you extend InodeOpsByType in partition.c to recognize your 
partition type. 

5. link YOURifs.o and YOURsyscalls.a into libpartition.a.  Make sure
not to mock up the linking for other operating systems.
